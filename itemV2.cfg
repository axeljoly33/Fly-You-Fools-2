DISCLAIMER: It is recommended to disable any other flight mod to make this one works.

Fly You Fools 2nd edition (also called FYF - named after a Lord of the Rings reference) - Flight Mod. This mod is acting as a beta (or a preview). After a period of time and bugfixing if necessary, FYF will be updated with FYF 2nd edition and this mod will disappear.
Remarks, bug reports or suggestions for new features are highly appreciated: contact me on Discord (Uganda#4769) or write something in the comment section!

It features:
- Flight toggle using custom keybind (F4 to set it up).
- 1st person flight mode.
- 6 DoF camera and movement (including Up/Down using Crouch/Jump keys).
- User standard FoV or custom in-flight FoV.
- Adjustable flight speed modifier and speed step modifier using mouse wheel.
- Adjustable, optional and customizable UI widget to display flight informations.
- Option to hide HUD, player model arms and weapons.
- Invisibility, invincibility and zero collision through environment nor living objects.
- Prevent your character from dying to death walls. Works both on host and clients.
- Prevent bugs by deactivating flight when a game is ending (session launch, defeat, win, restart).
\n
You are now able to fly out of these following state (death is not a valid state for activating flight):
- Transported by an unit (like an elevator)
- Hooked by a packmaster (even hanging from the hook)
- Hanging to a ledge
- Grabbed by chaos spawn
- Catapulted
- Distracted by flies
- Overcharging
- Waiting for respawn
- Knocked down
